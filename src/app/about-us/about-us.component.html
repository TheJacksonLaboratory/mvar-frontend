                                <p> For more than 80 years, the Mouse Mutant Resource at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX)
                                    has characterized naturally occurring variants causing Mendelian phenotypes in the
                                    vast population of laboratory mice that are maintained in JAX vivaria. Roughly 150
                                    novel phenotypes arise in these colonies each year as expected based on known
                                    frequencies of spontaneous mutation and expected rates of fixation under selective
                                    breeding paradigms. The goal of forward genetics is to rapidly identify the genetic
                                    variants that cause heritable phenotypes. High throughput sequencing technologies
                                    and population scale variant data allow for rapid prioritization of the most
                                    plausible pathogenic mutations based on their frequency among these highly related,
                                    primarily isogenic strains of Mus musculus domesticus. The Mouse Mutant Database
                                    provides access to aggregated, annotated variant calls generated from high
                                    throughput sequencing of these strains with an emphasis on strains harboring
                                    recently acquired mutations that cause Mendelian disease phenotypes. Our V.2 dataset
                                    currently encompasses over 33.5 million SNP and INDEL variants and 11.6 million
                                    structural variants from ~450 samples representing more than 350 unique mouse
                                    strains. Database expansion and improvements for V.3 will include enhanced tools for
                                    structural variant visualization, as well as tools for direct upload and annotation
                                    of user-generated VCF files. This work is funded by NIH OD021325.
