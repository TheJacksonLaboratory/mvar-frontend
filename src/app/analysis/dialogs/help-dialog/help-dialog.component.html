                position</p>

            <p><strong>Mutation Candidate</strong> – A variant is a mutation candidate if its occurrence is low (0-1%
                frequency where variants found in a single sample are ~0%), its genotype is supported by the phenotype
                of the sample and the inheritance of the phenotype (e.g. for autosomal recessive phenotypes, an affected

            <p><strong>Sample Name</strong> – The name of the sample provided by the owner of the sample / data</p>

            <p><strong>JAX Registry ID</strong> – This is the JR or JAX strain ID which can be used to search the
                Jackson Laboratory Strain database or the Mouse Genome Database for additional strain information. Link
                out to the JAX Strain datasheet and ordering information</p>

                sequencing information if the data were generated by Genome Technologies at The Jackson Laboratory</p>

            <p><strong>Chromosome Linkage</strong> – If mapping data are available for the phenotype, this is the
                chromosome containing the SNPs with the most significant LOD scores</p>

            <p><strong>Genotype</strong> – this is inferred (if possible) from inheritance and phenotypic status of the
                sample</p>

            <p><strong>Study</strong> – This is the identifier for the study from which the data were generated. WES:
                whole exome sequencing (paired end is default), WGS: whole genome sequencing (paired end is default),
                MP: mate pair or long jump library, SE: single end</p>

            <p><strong>Platform</strong> – relevant to whole exome sequencing, this is the version of the exome capture

            <p><strong>Likely pathogenic</strong> – A variant is a likely pathogenic (y) if its occurrence is low (0-1%

                of the sample and the inheritance of the phenotype (e.g. for autosomal recessive phenotypes, an affected

            <p><strong>Confirmed mutations</strong> – This is reserved for those mutation candidate / likely pathogenic
                variants that have been confirmed through linkage analysis and / or PCR validation to be the putative
                mutation causing the phenotype that is annotated for a given sample. This field is user provided and is

            <p><br>Structural variant calls from reference (GRCm38) based on whole genome sequence data, and generated
                from
                a consensus structural variant calling pipeline based on 4 callers (Breakdancer, Delly, Lumpy, and
                Manta) for laboratory mouse genomes.</p>

            <p><strong>Type</strong> – Structural variant type classed into the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>INS – Insertion</li>
                <li>INV – Inversion</li>
                <li>DEL – Deletion</li>

                <li>TRA – Translocation</li>
            </ul>


            <p><strong>Start Position</strong> – Starting position of the SV call. Note for translocation events this
                position represents a single breakpoint, rather than the start of a range.</p>

            <p><strong>End Position</strong> – Ending position of the SV call. Note for translocation events this
                position represents a single breakpoint, rather than the end of a range.</p>

            <p><strong>Length</strong> – Size of the SV event. Note: For Insertion calls accurate size prediction is not
                possible with available tools. Rather start and end position show region where an insertion is predicted
                to be present. For translocations, start and end position represent predicted locations of where a
                translocation event has occurred, and size prediction is not possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Occurrence %</strong> - The frequency of the structural variant within the MMRdb variant
                database.

            <p><strong>Supporting Callers</strong> – The number of structural variant callers supporting each call.
                Total possible callers are four.</p>

            <p><strong>Mutation Candidate</strong> – A variant is a likely pathogenic (y) if its occurrence is low (0-1%
                frequency where variants found in a single sample are ~0%), its genotype is supported by the phenotype
                of the sample and the inheritance of the phenotype (e.g. for autosomal recessive phenotypes, an affected
